## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated PostgreSQL servers and clusters.<br />
a9s PostgreSQL for PCF is part of a number of a9s Data Services available in one Bundle. Visit the [anynines website](https://www.anynines.com/) for more information. Developers can create instances of a PostgreSQL server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface (cf CLI), and bind these instances to an application.
Depending on the chosen service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated virtual machine,
or a set of VMs consisting of multiple virtual machines comprising a cluster of PostgreSQL servers.

### <a id="current"></a> Current Features

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF includes the following key features:

<table class="nice">
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Benefits</th>
 <tr>
 <td>On&dash;demand Service Instance Provisioning</td>
 <td>
   <ul>
     <li>Fully-automated deployment of PostgreSQL. Developers can provision a single-VM PostgreSQL server or a multi-VM PostgreSQL cluster with a single command.</li>
     <li>Only existing service instances allocate infrastructure resources, which are released when you delete the service instance.</li>
     <li>The number of service instances is not limited by design.</li>
   </ul>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Service Instance Isolation</td>
 <td>
    <ul>
        <li>Each PostgreSQL server runs on a dedicated virtual machine to ensure bad neighborhood protection and align with enterprise security requirements.</li>
     <li>Cloud Foundry security groups ensure that only authorized applications connect to service instances.</li>
   </ul>
 </td>
 <tr>
<td>High Availability</td>
<td>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://repmgr.org/">Replication Manager for PostgreSQL</a> ensures high availability.</li>
    <li>Consul-based internal DNS delivered by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected app always connects to a working node.</li>
    <li>The clustered data service plans are spread across several infrastructure availability zones, which enables very short failover times and a strong resilience of individual infrastructure hosts or even entire availability zones.</li>
  </ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smoke Tests</td>
<td>a9s PostgreSQL for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke test errand that runs a series of basic tests against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syslog streaming</td>
<td>a9s PostgreSQL for PCF provides the possibility to stream the logs of each a9s PostgreSQL for PCF component to a sys log endpoint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Instance Capacity Upgrade</td>
<td>Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your PostgreSQL instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logging and Monitoring</td>
<td>Each PostgreSQL service instance provides log messages and PostgreSQL-specific metrics to one or more <code>syslog/graphite</code> endpoints. You can configure the <code>syslog/graphite</code> endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deployment Updater</td>
<td>This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s PostgreSQL for PCF service instances to their lastest version.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Backup Manager</td>
<td>The Backup Manager makes a regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Dashboard</td>
<td>The Service Dashboard provides a single sign on and lets the user trigger easily backups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Guard</td>
<td>The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br />
    When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group.
    The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance.<b>
    The instances of one application are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances</td>
<td>In the tile a default endpoint for syslog and graphite can be configured for each service instances which is greated by the end user. </td>
</tr>
