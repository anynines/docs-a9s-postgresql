This documentation describes the a9s PostgreSQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
tile. a9s PostgreSQL for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated
PostgreSQL servers and clusters. Developers can create instances of a PostgreSQL
server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface
(cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application. Depending on your service
plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated VM or a set
of VMs consisting of multiple VMs containing a PostgreSQL cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated
PostgreSQL servers and clusters.<br />
a9s PostgreSQL for PCF is part of a number of a9s Data Services available in one
Bundle. Visit the [anynines website](https://www.anynines.com/) for more information.
Developers can create instances of a PostgreSQL server or cluster using Apps
Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface (cf CLI), and bind these
instances to an application.
Depending on the chosen service plan, a service instance may be associated with
a single, dedicated virtual machine, or a set of VMs consisting of multiple virtual
machines comprising a cluster of
PostgreSQL servers.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones, clustered data
service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against failures of
individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.

### <a id="current"></a> Current Features

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **On-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s PostgreSQL for PCF deploys PostgreSQL instances automatically. Developers can provision a single VM PostgreSQL server or a multi VM PostgreSQL using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each PostgreSQL server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s PostgreSQL for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized apps.
| **High Availability** | The <a href="http://repmgr.org/">Replication Manager for PostgreSQL</a> ensures high availability. <br/> Consul-based internal DNS delivered by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected app always connects to a working node. <br /> The clustered data service plans are spread across several infrastructure availability zones, which enables very short failover times and a strong resilience of individual infrastructure hosts or even entire availability zones. |
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s PostgreSQL for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke test errand that runs a series of basic tests against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly.|
| **Syslog streaming** | a9s PostgreSQL for PCF provides the possibility to stream the logs of each a9s PostgreSQL for PCF component to a sys log endpoint.|
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your PostgreSQL instances.|
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each PostgreSQL service instance provides log messages and PostgreSQL-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information.|
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s PostgreSQL for PCF service instances to their lastest version.|
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager makes a regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups.|
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides a single sign on and lets the user trigger easily backups.|
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. |
| **Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile, a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instance created by the user. |
| **Consul Domain configurable** | The consul domain can now be configured. |
| **BOSH DNS Handler** | a9s BOSH DNS handler added to make a9s service instances accessible from Diego cells. |
| **a9s-pg Backup** | Added backup option for a9s-pg. |
| **Instance Sharing** | a9s PostgreSQL no supports instance sharing between orgs an spaces, see [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html).|
| **Update Xenial** | Update to Ubuntu Xenial stemcells. |
