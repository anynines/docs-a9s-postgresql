## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated PostgreSQL servers and clusters.
Developers can create instances of a PostgreSQL server or cluster using Apps Manager
or the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface (cf CLI), and bind these instances to an application.
Depending on the chosen service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated virtual machine,
or a set of VMs consisting of multiple virtual machines comprising a cluster of PostgreSQL servers.

### <a id="current"></a>Current Features

a9s PostgreSQL for PCF includes the following key features:

<table class="nice">
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Benefits</th>
 <tr>
 <td>On&dash;demand Service Instance Provisioning</td>
 <td>
   <ul>
     <li>Fully automated deployment of PostgreSQL. Developers can provision a single-VM PostgreSQL server or a multi-VM PostgreSQL cluster with a single command.</li>
     <li>Only existing service instances allocate infrastructure resources, which are released when you delete the service instance.</li>
     <li>The number of service instances is not limited by design.</li>
   </ul>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Service Instance Isolation</td>
 <td>
    <ul>
        <li>Each PostgreSQL server runs on a dedicated virtual machine to ensure bad neighborhood protection and align with enterprise security requirements.</li>
     <li>Cloud Foundry security groups ensure that only authorized applications connect to service instances.</li>
   </ul>
 </td>
 <tr>
<td>High Availability</td>
<td>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://repmgr.org/">Replication Manager for PostgreSQL</a> ensures high availability.</li>
    <li>Consul-based internal DNS delivered by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected app always connects to a working node.</li>
    <li>The clustered data service plans are spread across several infrastructure availability zones, which enables very short failover times and a strong resilience of individual infrastructure hosts or even entire availability zones.</li>
  </ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smoke Tests</td>
<td>a9s MongoDB for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic tests against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Instance Capacity Upgrade</td>
<td>Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your MongoDB instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service Instance Capacity Upgrade</td>
<td>Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your MongoDB instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logging and Monitoring</td>
<td>Each MongoDB service instance provides log messages and MongoDB-specific metrics to one or more <code>syslog/graphite</code> endpoints. You can configure the <code>syslog/graphite</code> endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deployment Updater</td>
<td>This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s MongoDBs for PCF service instances to their lastest version.</td>
</tr>
<td>Backup Manager</td>
<td>The Backup Manager makes a regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups.</td>
</tr>
<td>Service Guard</td>
<td>The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br />
    When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group.
    The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance.<b>
    The instances of one application are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.</b></td>

[//]: # (The following features have been developed and tested on <a href="https://paas.anynines.com/" target="_blank">paas.anynines.com</a>.)
[//]: # (These features will be included in upcoming a9s PostgreSQL for PCF tile releases.)

[//]: # (| Feature | Benefits |)
[//]: # (|---|---|)
[//]: # (| On&dash;demand Encrypted Remote Connectivity | You can establish a private encrypted tunnel to your service instance on&dash;demand. Developers can use this connection to perform manual backups. As soon as the public connection is obsolete, you can terminate the tunnel to prevent further access. An additional component, the Service Jumper Module, provides this functionality. |)
